## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about SASS and new extensions:

1. Live SASS Compiler (VS Code)
2. PerfectPixel By WellDoneCode (Chrome Extension)

PerfectPixel helped me adjust the tiniest details by overlaying the design challenge to my solution.

### Continued development

I want to improve my file structuring and apply best practices on sass and HTML too.
